I am a passionate data analyst with a keen eye for detail and a drive for extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets. My goal is to leverage data to drive informed decision-making and contribute to business success.

With over 8 years of experience in the veterinary field and customer service, I bring a unique perspective to data analysis, combining my expertise in patient care with analytical skills. I have a Bachelor's degree in Health Science from California State University, Fullerton, and I am a recent graduate from the Data Analyst Professional program from TripleTen Online Bootcamp (formally known as Practicum Online Bootcamp).

In my professional journey, I have developed a strong proficiency in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools such as Tableau. I am experienced in conducting exploratory data analysis, identifying trends, and providing actionable insights. 

Beyond my technical skills, I am a dedicated and organized professional, adept at managing projects and collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams. I thrive in dynamic and fast-paced environments, where I can apply my problem-solving abilities and communication skills to drive impactful outcomes.

Outside of work, you can find me hanging out with my dog, Pancake, exploring new delicious food finds, or doing something fitness related. 

I am excited about the endless possibilities that data analysis offers and the potential to make a meaningful impact through data-driven decision-making. If you're interested in collaboration or have any questions, feel free to reach out.
